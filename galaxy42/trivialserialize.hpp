/***
@brief Generates the serialized data string, from input data like bytes and strings of various types.
@note About string types, following are possible:
- conststr: strings of constant length of N characters (during read, and during write, the caller knows the size is exactyl N)
- octetsvarstr: We support strings that length is variable, but it is known (during read, and write, the caller tells us) to which string-length the string belongs:
-- is it a string with length <= 2^(8*S) -1 for S=1 (using 1 octet to encode own width)
-- is it a string with length <= 2^(8*S) -1 for S=2
-- is it a string with length <= 2^(8*S) -1 for S=3
-- is it a string with length <= 2^(8*S) -1 for S=4
-- If the program tells the string has S=3 but actuall data is always shorter then e.g. 256, so would fit in S=1, then this is fine of course, though.
always there is wasted space (e.g. of 1 byte) in the serialized format.
- varstring: we COULD have one that uses 4 bytes to encode length when it is long, but uses just 1 byte when it is e.g. 250; bitcoin uses such mechanism. Not implemented (yet?).
- cstring: we COULD have null-delimited string. Not implemented (yet?).
