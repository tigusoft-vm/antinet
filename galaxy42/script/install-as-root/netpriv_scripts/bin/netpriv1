# Part of netpriv: create namespace (part1)

# log it:
logger -s -- "Setting network namespace  PID=$$ PPID=$PPID in $0, then run command: $*"

set -x # for more debug

# create a new namespace (and run futher commands in it]),
# return in it back to the original user who called the sudo (SUDO_USER) <--- this MUST!!! be done to not
# by mistake give root access to the user who is allowed to create netpriv!
# e.g the start-containers script uses that to call other steps inside the namespace, then this other steps 
# are the extra command that will be executed there
unshare --net -- sudo -u "${SUDO_USER}" "$@"
# su -l
# ${SUDO_USER} 

# once this command is done, we will just debug:
echo "" "Unshare done for PID=$$ PPID=$PPID"
